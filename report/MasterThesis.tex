\abstract{
A \manet is a network of moving nodes that without intervention of humans can route messages between nodes, given that the nodes are in proximity of each other, or there is a path of nodes in proximity of each other. 

In this thesis I will give an overview of the basic requirements for implementing a \manet and suggest many already existing solutions that forfills these requirements. 

Furthermore I will give a performence evaluation of several routing algorithms using the ns-2.33 network simulator and the \hls.
