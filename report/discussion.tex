\subsection{Choice of routing graph}

From the results presented in section~\ref{section:test_results}, it becomes clear that our assumption about the ad- and disadvantages of the three different types are correct. The Non-planar graph is the one needing the fewest hops and the smallest distance on average to go from the source to the sink, but has far more neighbours than the other two. The \ac{gabe} lies in the middle between the non-planar graph and the \ac{rng} with regards to distance/hops, while the \ac{rng} has the fewest neighbours, but also the longest distance/hops. 

The question is then which of these graphs would be optimal in a \ac{manet}. As mentioned earlier the problem with having many neighbours is not the cost in transmitting (that value is fixed by using the \ac{uga}), but rather the bookkeeping involved in remembering all the neighbours, and picking one when sending a message. Given this I would argue that having an average 10 or more neighbours are not acceptable, when alternatives with only around 2 or 3 exist. However, it is also clear that there is a clear cost of minimum number of hops when looking at figure~\ref{graph:avg_neighbour} and figure~\ref{graph:dist_percent}, which clearly shows us that the \ac{gabe} and \ac{rng} requires far more hops on average to get from the source to the sink than the non-planar graph. Given their planar nature, this is not surprising. 

Based on this I would recommend using the \ac{gabe}, since it reduces the average number of neighbours with an average that, regardless of the number of nodes in the graph, lies very close to 3 with a very small standard deviation\footnote{See table~\ref{table:neigh_100} through table~\ref{table:neigh_10000} on p. \pageref{table:neigh_100}}, while having requiring fewer hops on average compared to the \ac{rng}, as seen in both figure~\ref{graph:avg_neighbour} figure~\ref{graph:dist_percent}.

\subsection{Euclidian distance}

In figure~\ref{graph:dist_percent} and figure~\ref{graph:euclid_distance} we clearly see that the Euclidian distance for both graphs tops in the begining, and then begins to flat out. One should think that this would be a good argument for it being a spanner, but muddling the picture is the fact that the standard deviation for all the graphs is also increasing as the number of nodes increases.  

\subsection{Hop distance}

\graphResult{spanner/unit_distance}{A closer look at the unit distance compared to the non-planar graph. Uses the same data as figure~\ref{graph:dist_percent}}{unit_distance}

From figure~\ref{graph:dist_percent} and figure~\ref{unit_distance}we can clearly see from the number of hops (the dashed lines), that they are slowly converting on
