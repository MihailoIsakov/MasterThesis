This directory contains the files needed to build my report.

The report is written in the LaTeX document preparation system. Since I like to have my image files in the .eps file format, I have opted first to produce a .dvi version of my report, and then transform this into a pdf version. 

===How to build the report===
In order to build the report to build type "make pdf" (to create a pdf) or "make dvi" or just "make" in order to make a dvi file.

===Requirements===
In order to produce my report, you will need the "latex" tool and the "dvipdft" tool, both of which can be installed for many all linux distributions.
