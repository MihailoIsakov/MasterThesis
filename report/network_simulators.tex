\section{Network simulators}

In order to test any algorithm I might implement, I will need a network simulator, to check how good it is compared to already existing algorithms. I have been able to identify 4 big network simulators: ns-2, ns-3, GloMoSim and the Opnet Modeler.

\begin{description}
\item[ns-2:] ns-2 is a discrete event network simulator. The last version I have been able to find is from 2009. ns-2 uses the programming language Otcl for most of its non-core engine files -- such as routing algorithms and the scenario files that configures how the test is to be performed.
\item[ns-3:] ns-3 is the successor to ns-2 in an attempt to make a clean break from the architecture of ns-2 and its reliance on Otcl in favor for Python (and then only in scenario files) 
\item[GloMoSim:] GloMoSim is a parallel discrete-event simulator. GloMoSim is an old simulator. I have not been able   . GloMoSim uses the programming language \emph{Parsec}, a dialect of C, to write most of the non-core engine files -- such as routing algorithms. 
\item[Opnet Modeler:] Opnet is a commercial network simulator. Every layer of the network stack has to be modelled as a finite state machine \cite{MANcom}. 
\end{description}

From \cite{MANcom} it is clear that the Network simulators gives widely different results. Since it is not clear which of the simulators which gives the result that is closest to reality, the parameters I will have to apply to find the best network simulator are: The license and cost of the network simulator. When it was last updated, how configurable any given simulation is, whether or not it supports wireless routing, how much memory it consumes while running, which languages are required to implement a new protocol, how may languages are required to implement a new scenario, how many articles cite the simulator \todo{figure out whether or not this should be removed}, and whether new routing protocols can just be plugged in, or if the entire network simulator has to be recompiled. For Configurability and memory I will grade them with using A, B and C, where A is the highest and C is the lowest.

All of the simulators have simple node mobility models built-in. I have however chosen to use a third-party program, BonnMotion\footnote{BonnMotion has been produced as a collaboration between the University of Bonn and the Toilers at \url{toilers.mines.edu} -- last accessed the 16/5 2011} on the grounds that it supports a far greater range of mobility models -- such as ``Disaster Area'', ``Gauss-Markow'' -- enables me to store the movments to ensure that I can get consistent results, and it can be configured to output both ns-2 and GloMoSim movement traces.

Based on the above, I have choosen to use the ns-2 simulator, since it is far more customizable than both ns-3 and GloMoSim and still being supported, unlike GloMoSim.
