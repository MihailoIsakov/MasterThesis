\section{Fundamental Graph Routing}
\label{fundamental}
In this section I will describe the fundamentals of graph routing and introduce definitions and terminology that I will use throughout this thesis.\\

In order to be able to reason about \manet, we will have to model it. The most logical of these is that of the graph. A graph $G$ is a set of \emph{nodes} $V$ and \emph{edges} $E$ that connects the points, and which may have a cost to use -- often refereed to as the edges \emph{weight}. The nodes are represented as points, while the edges are represented as line-segments, with their endpoints being 2 different nodes. In this thesis I will only work with graphs that exist in the plane. I find this to be a reasonable simplification, since it makes the graphs far simpler to reason about, but also because almost all the literature about \manet and \anet I have been able to find does the same. 

The object of routing in any network is to send a \emph{message} -- which contains both the data to be delivered, but also Meta-data need for routing, like last visited node --- from its origin, in this thesis defined as the \emph{source}, to some destination node, In this thesis defined as the \emph{sink}. The ordered set of nodes that the messages passes while it is being routed from the source to the sink will in this thesis be defined as the \emph{path}. In most routing algorithms, the goal is to find the \emph{shortest path} from the source to the sink, where the shortest path can either be the path that contains the fewest nodes, or the path that has the least weight. In cases where the weight of all edges is 1, these are the same. 

In some cases there may be multiple sources and sinks, but in this thesis I will focus only on the cases where there is one of each. I will now explain how I have chosen to model this network. 

Given two nodes $n_x$ and $n_y$ in the graph, I will say that $n_x$ is \emph{adjacent} to $n_y$, iff $n_x$ can send a message to $n_y$ directly (i.e. $n_y$ lies within the range of $n_x$ transmitter). However, just because $n_x$ is adjacent to $n_y$ does not mean that the two nodes can communicate\footnote{Two-way communication is important, since in most routing protocols, $n_x$ would need a confirmation that $n_y$ did indeed receive its message, this might be impossible with one-way communication.\hide{, but $n_y$ will be unable to send it to $n_x$. A possible solution could be to transmit the file through a different path to $n_x$, but I feel this would be too complex.}}, since we do not know whether or not $n_x$'s transmitter is more powerful than $n_y$'s. I will therefore say that two nodes nodes $n_x$ and $n_y$ can only communicate if there exists a \emph{bidirectional link} between the nodes, and that a bidirectional link exist iff $n_x$ is adjacent to $n_y$ and $n_y$ is adjacent to $n_x$.

\tikfig{connec-route}{Figure~\ref{fig:nodes} shows a set of nodes. The circle indicates the range of node a's transmission -- all the other nodes has the same range, have not been drawn for clarity's sake. Figure~\ref{fig:connec} shows us the connectivity graph given the nodes and transmission radius indicated in figure~\ref{fig:nodes}. Figure~\ref{fig:routing_not_planar} and \ref{fig:routing_planar} are examples of routing graph, a subset of the connectivity graph. Since figure~\ref{fig:routing_planar} is planar, it would be preferred over figure~\ref{fig:routing_not_planar}.}

Now we can begin to define the \emph{connectivity graph}. Given a set of nodes $V$ the connectivity graph C will be $C = (V, E)$, where $E$ contains an edge between node $n_x$ and $n_y$ iff there is a bidirectional link between $n_x$ and $n_y$ -- see figure~\ref{fig:connec}. It is important to note that the connectivity graph only tells us which nodes that can communicate, not how the graph is going to route the message. Therefore I introduce the \emph{Routing Graph} R, where $R = (V, E\prime)$, where $E\prime \subseteq E$. It is this graph $R$ that the message will have to navigate in order to go from the source to the sink.

\tikfig{graphTop}{An example of the difference between Geometrical and Topological movement. For clarity I have opted not to include node c's transmission radius. In \ref{fig:graphTop2} node b has moved around inside node a and node c's transmission intersection, but since there has been no chance in which nodes node b is adjacent to, b is still a neighbour to both nodes. In \ref{fig:graphTop3} node b has moved outside of node a's transmission radius, but is still inside node c's radius, changing the topology of the graph.}

Since we are dealing with mobile units, the topology of the graph may change as the nodes move around, which means that there must be a mechanism that updates the topology. Since each node has an area it can monitor, its \emph{transmission area}, we will have to be careful to distinguish between \emph{Geometrical movement}, where the node moves, but the topology of the network stays the same, and \emph{Topological movement}, where the movement of the nodes causes the topology to change. I have illustrated the difference in figure~\ref{fig:graphTop}. 

In the rest of the thesis assume we are working in an idealised world, where the transmission radius is a perfect unit disc, and that the radio transmission does not decrease by the distance. This is of course not the case in the real world, but it makes the reasoning much easier\todo{work on this}.


\subsection{Mathematical terminology}
\defi{Given two nodes $n_x$ and $n_y$ in the plane. Then $\overline{n_xn_y}$ will indicate that there is an edge between node $n_x$ and $n_y$.}
\defi{Let $x$ be an edge, then $|x|$ is the length of $x$ in the space that is it. If no space is explicitly mentioned, this is the Euclidean space.}
