@inproceedings{realistic,
    abstract = {{Accurately simulating user movements in mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) is very important to the prediction of actual network and user performance. Therefore, using a realistic mobility model is a crucial factor in enhancing the confidence in the simulation results of these networks. In this paper, we present a new mobility model for MANETs, called realistic mobility model (RMM). In RMM, node velocities and directions of movement are taken from probability distributions that mimic real user mobility behavior. The model is shown to be stationary since it satisfies the conditions of (J.Y. Lee et al., 2005). Simulation results show that RMM produces mobility traces that closely resemble real mobility traces.}},

@article{martinMeshnetwork,
    abstract = {{In spite of the massive efforts in researching and developing mobile ad hoc networks in the last decade, this type of network has not yet witnessed mass market deployment. The low commercial penetration of products based on ad hoc networking technology could be explained by noting that the ongoing research is mainly focused on implementing military or specialized civilian applications. On the other hand, users are interested in general-purpose applications where high bandwidth and open access to the Internet are consolidated and cheap commodities. To turn mobile ad hoc networks into a commodity, we should move to more pragmatic "opportunistic ad hoc networking" in which multihop ad hoc networks are not isolated self-configured networks, but rather emerge as a flexible and low-cost extension of wired infrastructure networks coexisting with them. Indeed, a new class of networks is emerging from this view: mesh networks. This article provides an overview of mesh networking technology. In particular, starting from commercial case studies we describe the core building blocks and distinct features on which wireless mesh networks should be based. We provide a survey of the current state of the art in off-the-shelf and proprietary solutions to build wireless mesh networks. Finally, we address the challenges of designing a high-performance, scalable, and cost-effective wireless mesh network.}},

@book{CompuGeo,
    abstract = {{This well-accepted introduction to computational geometry is a textbook for
high-level undergraduate and low-level graduate courses. The focus is on
algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science
and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all
solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular
applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information
systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern
insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both
efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and
topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics,
are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study
by anyone with a basic background in algorithms.

In this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections
discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams,
and realistic input models have been added.}},
