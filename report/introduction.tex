\section{Introduction}


\subsection{Justification}
In the last few years we have seen a clear increase in the sale of mobile phones with an advanced OS, internet access, GPS and large amounts of computing power. These so-called \emph{Smart Phones} are becomming increasingly commen \justify{Find numbers or source}, replacing the standard mobile phone. Developers are encouraged to write custom applications to these small mobile compouters.

Many of these Smart Phones has a build-in GPS or WiFi triangulation tools, which can be access by the applications on the phone, making it possible to create services that uses the users data - such as directional services (such as Google Maps) or social networking services (such as Foursquare).

In normal Ad-Hoc research energy conservation is usualy a high priority. Sine Ad-Hoc networks has mostly been used for sensor networks for research this makes sense. Since the sensor networks are mostly deployed in inhospitable and inaccessable regions, this makes sense, since it is unlikely that any of the batteries will ever be recharged. However, this underlying assumption is not true when applied to Laptops, Netbooks and Smart Phones in the developed world.
