\subsection{Future work}
\label{section:future_work}
It would be interesting to see an analysis of the Non-planar, the \ac{gabe}, the \ac{rng} as well as the \ac{rdg} on graphs created by either algorithms that produced some sort of node clustering, or perhaps extracted from the output of mobility models (either just the conditions at a single time-point or a series that analysis the different graphs over the lifetime of the movement simulation). For this the Nomadic Community Mobility Model, Pursue Mobility Model and Reference Point Group Mobility Model \cite{MobilityAdHocResearch} or the Disaster Area mobility model \cite{disasterArea}.

Another topic worth looking into would be to see what traffic models there existed, and compare different traffic generators.
